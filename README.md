Tremor Tics App Source Code


Tests for tremors and tics by measuring the accelerating deviation of the user’s hand. It produces a result according to intensity of the deviation of the phone by using the phone’s built in accelerometers. The app is designed to flag once there is a deviation of more than 1 m/s^2 of the user’s hand. The test will produce a score and the outcome of the score will either be negative - no tremors detected or few detected and are considered either as human error or benign - or positive - severe Tremors detected. The app stores records of tests taken so that it can be viewed at a later stage and/or be sent to a corresponding doctor, or personal if the user wishes too. All the data stored from the tests taken by the user can be accessed in a spreadsheet via third party apps. The app is mainly designed and programmed to detect severe tremors which may be the cause of Tourette Syndrome. Tourette Syndrome is an extreme case of tremors and tics usually present in small kids ranging from ages of 7 and above. This app provides users the ability to have a record of their tremors so that they don’t have to regularly go to the doctor for examination, as being diagnosed with tremors requires months of examination which can be expensive, especially for people suffering in rural areas. Moreover, this app educates people about tremors such as : what causes them, diseases linked to, its possible cures, and etc.
